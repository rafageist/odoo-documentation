# HR v18 vs v19

> **Summary:** Tracks employee/master-data evolutions between v18 and v19 for HR teams. Link to `[[Odoo 18/Community Addons/HR]]` for baseline behaviour.

## Key observations so far
- Employees now inherit from `hr.version`; records are versioned with `version_id`, `current_version_id`, and helper counts, enabling historical tracking per employee.
- Presence and communication fields (`hr_presence_state`, `hr_icon_display`, `last_activity_time`) derive from new mail/presence integrations and user status propagation.
- Bank account handling supports multiple accounts with distribution metadata (`salary_distribution`) and trusted flags, replacing the single `bank_account_id` field.
- Several personal-information fields (gender, marital status, spouse details) moved to versioned models; birthday sharing introduces `birthday_public_display` logic.
- Search domains adopt the `Domain` helper and new SQL/query utilities, while email/phone fields normalise via `email_normalize` and user relations.

## Migration hints
- Adjust custom views/logic that previously assumed a single bank account; use the new many-to-many relation and distribution JSON structure.
- Update access rules and computed fields relying on removed columns (e.g., `marital`, `gender`) to read from version objects if needed.
- Consider the versioning model when writing overrides for employee updatesâ€”many fields are now inherited from `hr.version` with compute methods.
- Replace manual presence indicators with the new `_compute_presence_state` / `_compute_presence_icon` outputs.

## Next steps
- Investigate how `hr.version` stores historical data and document migration steps for third-party modules.
- Review attendance/payroll modules for dependencies on the new salary distribution flow.
- Update portal or directory features to honour `birthday_public_display`.
