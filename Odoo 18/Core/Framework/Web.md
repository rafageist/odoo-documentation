# web (Core Framework)

## Analysis tracks
- Legacy OWL components in v18 and their relationship with QWeb.
- Asset management (`ir.asset`, bundles, SCSS/JS).
- Key JavaScript APIs (`web.core`, `web.rpc`, `web.session`).

## PlantUML ideas
- Class diagram for the main JS services.
- Sequence for rendering web-client views.
